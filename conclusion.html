        <p>The life of a bee is incredible and amazes me. The way that the whole colony gets together and cooperates to
            protect it, as well as build their hives and shape them, is mesmerizing. Every single one of these three
            types of bees plays a pivotal role in maintaining their colony. The queen will take care of the colony by
            laying eggs, the drones spreading their genes in the colony, and the workers protect and die for their queen
            and the colony.
