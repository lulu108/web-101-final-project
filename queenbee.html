        <p> The queen bee is the most important bee in a colony; the colony depends on its queen. You can recognize the
            queen by its large abdomen and the worker bees that follow and protect her (Jernigan). According to
            Christopher Jernigan “There is only one queen in each colony, if the second one was to appear, they will
            fight until only one of them is left standing” (Jernigan). Queens are reproductive and it is their duty to
            lay eggs; by laying close to 1500 eggs she can maintain the size of the colony (Jernigan). On average the
            queen bee lives between one to two years and becomes sexually mature 6 days after emergence. They mate with
            up to 17 male bees (Remolina).</p>
