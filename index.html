        <p> Honeybees are social insects and just like most insects, they live in a group which is called a hive. The
            bees build their hives in hexagonal (six-sides) shaped cells and they use wax to build them. Hundreds of
            these cells are called honeycombs. There are three types of bees within every hive, one queen bee, male bees
            known as drones, and female bees known as workers.</p>
