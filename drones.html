    <div class="container">
        <p>The second type of bee is male bees known as drones. They are unfertilized eggs and live only a few months
            out of the year. They are recognizable due to their strange and large eyes. The drone's only duty is to
            spread its genes in the colony and find a new queen to mate with. Their eyes cover their entire face, which
            helps them to spot queens easily while airborne. Another difference between female workers and drones is the
            latter don't have stingers (Jernigan).</p>
