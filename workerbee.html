        <p>Honeybee workers are all female. The worker's duties and tasks will change depending on their age. Their
            duties are within the nest, they are known as nurse bees because they not only take care of their queen but
            also the young bees known as larvae (Jernigan). After spending a few weeks inside the nest, their priorities
            change. They need to take their first flight outside of the nest, at this moment they become foragers that
            collect nectar and water. Being a forager is the hardest and most dangerous task for honey workers; most of
            the time, they get attacked by predators, get caught in a wind storm, or get diseases (Kidd).</p>
